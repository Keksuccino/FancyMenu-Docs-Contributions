# About

This repository is like a queue for user-generated documentation pages for [FancyMenu's docs](https://docs.fancymenu.net).

**I accept PRs here.**

If you want to write a page or pages, just send it as PR and if it's well-written, detailed and informative, I will add it to the actual docs later.

Please keep in mind that I will not add rushed, too short or uninformative pages, because otherwise the docs would become a confusing spam hell.

# Page Formatting

FancyMenu's documentation is formatted with Markdown, so you can use that in pages!

It's okay to use images, but no embedded videos please.

Thank you very much to all contributors who make the mod more accessible for others by writing docs pages! 🙏🏻
