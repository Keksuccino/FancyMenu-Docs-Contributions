# Window Icon & Title

FancyMenu allows you to change the icon and title of the Minecraft window.

![window_customization](https://github.com/Keksuccino/FancyMenu/assets/35544624/7ec0cf75-c79e-4398-b2e4-331c8fbae8b1)

# Custom Icon

To set a custom icon for the Minecraft window, navigate to **Customization -> Settings -> Custom Window Icon** in the **menu bar**.

- Icons need to be **PNG** files (and **ICNS for macOS**)
- Icons need to have at least **1 transparent pixel** to not look glitched (MC/LWJGL bug)
- You need to set valid files for all 3 icon versions (16x16, 32x32, macOS) to enable the custom icon toggle

> **Again**: Icons need to have at least **1 transparent pixel** to not look glitched (MC/LWJGL bug). The icon will look broken if it doesn't have at least one fully transparent pixel!
