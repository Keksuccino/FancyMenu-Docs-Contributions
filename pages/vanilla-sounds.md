# Vanilla Sounds & Music

It's possible to use Vanilla Minecraft's sounds and music in Audio elements and other stuff that take OGG audio files.

# Accessing Vanilla Sound Resources

To access Vanilla sound resources, you need to know their real resource location.

For example, the `bromeliad.ogg` music track is located at `assets/minecraft/sounds/music/game/`, so its resource location would be `minecraft:sounds/music/game/bromeliad.ogg`.

This image shows the resource location used in an Audio element:

An easy way to see the real resource locations of audio files is by using [mcasset.cloud](https://mcasset.cloud/1.20.6/assets/minecraft/sounds).
