# Sharing Layouts

Sharing your FancyMenu setup with others is pretty easy and no special knowledge is needed.

> This page is **ONLY** for FancyMenu setups made completely in **FancyMenu v3+**, so if you use a legacy setup (made in v2 and converted to v3), some steps could be different.

# Exporting and Importing

You simply need to export/import FancyMenu's config folder, that's all.

## Exporting

1. Navigate to the root directory of the Minecraft instance you made your layouts in.
2. Open the `config` folder of the Minecraft instance.
3. Copy the `fancymenu` folder of the `config` folder to your desktop or somewhere else.
4. Send this folder to the person you want to share your setup with.

## Importing

It is recommended to use a **FRESH** installation of FancyMenu without any layouts.

1. Download a FancyMenu setup from somewhere and find the `fancymenu` config folder in the setup.
1. Navigate to the `config` folder of your Minecraft instance.
2. If there is already a `fancymenu` folder in the `config` folder, **delete** the existing `fancymenu` folder.
3. Copy the `fancymenu` folder from **step 1** to the `config` folder of your Minecraft instance.
4. Restart your game and enjoy your new fancy menus!

> Please keep in mind that old legacy setups made in FancyMenu v2 (even if converted to v3) allowed you to store layout assets outside FancyMenu's `/config/fancymenu/assets/` folder, so in that case you need to make sure you also export/import all assets.
