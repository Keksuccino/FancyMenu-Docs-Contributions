# Bring Back Deleted Vanilla Elements

To make deleted/hidden Vanilla elements like buttons, logos or other types of elements visible again, just open the layout you deleted them in, then **navigate to the menu bar -> Element -> Deleted Vanilla Elements** and **left-click** the element(s) you want to make visible again.

If the deleted elements aren't listed in the menu, you have the wrong layout open and need to find the one you deleted them in.
