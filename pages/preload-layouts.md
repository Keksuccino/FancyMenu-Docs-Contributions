# Pre-Load Resources

In some scenarios it is recommended to pre-load resources.
This is mostly needed for high resolution images, audio files and web resources in general.

Pre-loading resources can help to remove possible image flickering or audio files not starting fast enough.

It is also recommended to pre-load animations (FMA files) to make it play smoothly and not lag or show a black screen when first loaded.

# Add Resources to the Pre-Loader

To add a resource to FancyMenu's resource pre-loader, just click on **Pre-Load Resources** in **Customization**.

This will open a menu that lets you add local resources, web resources and resource pack resources to a list.

Every resource in this list will get pre-loaded every time the game reloads its resources, so basically every time the resource loading screen is visible.
