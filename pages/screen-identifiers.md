# Screen Identifiers

FancyMenu uses screen identifiers to know which screen a layout belongs to, to point to a button in a specific screen and other things that require the mod to communicate with or customize a specific screen.

# Finding the Identifier of a Screen

You can see the identifier of the currently active menu by using the **Debug Overlay**.
It contains the current screen's identifier and allows you to copy it to the clipboard by left-clicking it.
