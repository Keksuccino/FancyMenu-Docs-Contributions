# OptiFine Alternatives

I do **_not_** officially support OptiFine.
It breaks like every mod and due to it being closed-source, it's extremely frustrating and time-consuming to fix bugs caused by it.

You should use Oculus/Iris and Rubidium/Sodium instead.
They are much more stable and don't break everything.

## Forge

- [Embeddium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/embeddium) (Performance)
