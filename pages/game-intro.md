# Game Intros

You know those cool little videos that play when you start a game?
FancyMenu lets you do this in Minecraft!

# APNGs and GIFs as Intro

FancyMenu supports animated textures (and soon videos) to be used as game intro.

To set an animated texture as intro, navigate to FancyMenu's **menu bar**, then **Customization -> Settings -> Game Intro**.
